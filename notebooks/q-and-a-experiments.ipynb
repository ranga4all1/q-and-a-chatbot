      "    Based on the provided context, Jane Doe has published several articles on 'Medium' with a significant number of views, including \"Mastering A/B Testing: A Data Analyst's Guide\" with 50K+ views, \"The Future of Big Data: Trends and Predictions\" with 35K+ views, and \"From Raw Data to Actionable Insights: A Step-by-Step Tutorial\" with 40K+ views. However, there is no mention of her publishing any research papers or articles on 'LinkedIn'. It is worth noting that her LinkedIn profile is listed, but it does not appear to be a platform for publishing research papers or articles. Therefore, the answer to the question is that Jane Doe has published articles on 'Medium' but not on 'LinkedIn'.    ```\n",
